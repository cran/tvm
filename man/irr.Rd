\title{The IRR is returned as an effective rate with periodicity equal to that of the cashflow}
\usage{
irr(cf, ts = seq(from = 0, by = 1, along.with = cf), interval = c(-1, 10), ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{cf}{The cashflow}

\item{ts}{The times on which the cashflow occurs. It is assumed that \code{cf[idx]} happens at moment \code{ts[idx]}}

\item{interval}{A length 2 vector that indicates the root finding algorithm where to search for the irr}

\item{...}{Other arguments to be passed on to uniroot}
}
\description{
Internal Rate of Return of a periodic cashflow (IRR)

\examples{
irr(cf = c(-1, 0.5, 0.9), ts = c(0, 1, 3))
